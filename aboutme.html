  <h4>Draw Shapes:Scratch</h4>
  <p> This is my first project with scratch. We had to create a program that was based on user input to make shapes. Bases on what the user
  put as there number.I first had to do a if/then statement inorder for the program to ask the user "How many sides for your shape?" The user 
  would then put a number for example if they put four they will get a square drawn out.Then you set a variable to 360 and the answer the user put for it to then repeat the answer, move 80 steps and turn the variable degrees.
